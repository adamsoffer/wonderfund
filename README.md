## Requirements
1. Node
2. testrpc & Metamask
3. Truffle

## Building and the frontend
1. Run `testrpc`
2. Point Metamask to your local network `http://localhost:8545`
3. Import account generated by testrpc into Metamask
4. Clone project at https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ETH-10-exam-projects/adamsoffer
5. Inside `FinalProject` run `truffle compile`, then run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts to the local network.
6. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
7. Run `npm run build` and then `npm start` to build the app and serve it on http://localhost:5000

## Testing
1. run `truffle test` to test the `refund` function in the `Project` contract

## Common Errors

* **Error: Can't resolve '../build/contracts/FundingHub.json'**

This means you haven't compiled or migrated your contracts yet. Run `truffle compile` and `truffle migrate` first.
